# Debugging with PyClewn

If you want to debug the Python parts of the code, you can do this with PyClewn

1. Write a test
2. Create a virtualenv for pyclewn:

        $ virtualenv ~/venvs/pyclewn
        $ source ~/venvs/pyclewn/bin/activate

3. Install pyclewn

        $ pip install pyclewn

4. Install test requirements

        $ pip install -r test_requirements.txt

5. Set the PYTHONPATH to the value calculated by `./run_tests` so that `nose`
   can find the modules when you run it.

        $ export PYTHONPATH=`./run_tests --dump-path`

6. Start *terminal* Vim. This does *not* work in GUI Vim.

        $ tvim python/ycm/vimsupport.py

7. Start PyClewn for pdb debugging. Note: You must you *absolute* paths for
   all arguments, which are:

 - The path to nosetests (`~/venvs/pyclewn/bin/nosetests`)
 - The path to YCM's `python` directory

        :Pyclewn pdb /Users/ben/venvs/pyclewn/bin/nosetests -v -w /Users/ben/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/python/ ycm.client.tests.command_request_test


8. Use PyClewn according to the docs. e.g.

        :e python/ycm/vimsupport.py
        :Cmapkeys
        <...>
        <C-B>
        <C-N>
        <S>
        etc.
